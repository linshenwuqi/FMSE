# Clustering Ensemble Based on Fuzzy Matrix Self-Enhancement

This is the demo of our paper: Xia Ji, Jiawei Sun, Jianhua Peng, Yue Pang, and Peng Zhou, Clustering Ensemble Based on Fuzzy Matrix Self-Enhancement.

You can directly run `main.m`.
> Notes:
> 
> * Hyper-parameters `theta` and `alpha` are tunable for better performance.  
> * All of our experiments use the seed `rng(1)` for re-producing.
